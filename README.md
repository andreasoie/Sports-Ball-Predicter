# Sports-Ball-Predicter
> A image classification model which tells you what kind of sports ball it is (or if its an egg).

## Notice

This is a terminal script running on a given PC, which opens the desired video source ready to perform prediction.

## Equipment
```
Intel® Core™ i7-8565U-prosessor
Standard 720p Webcam
```

## Disclaimer

This model was trained on actually images scraped from google, which translates weirdly if you preview them to the camera with an iPhone. Therefore, it was a bit cool to see it actually work even tho the testbed didn't quite meet the professional standards (in this case, through looking at my iPhone, lol). If we study the test photos, we can clearly see  signs of glare, image with different angles and distances between the camera and the object in focus. Due to beeing trained with a set of different data augmentations before, we could easily believe this could be the reason it handles different sorts of conditions quite acceptable.
