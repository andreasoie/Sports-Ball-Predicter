# Sports-Ball-Predicter
> A image classification model which tells you what kind of sports ball it is (or it its an egg).

## Notice

This is a terminal script running on a given PC, which opens the desired video source ready to perform prediction.

## Equipment
```
Intel® Core™ i7-8565U-prosessor
Standard 720p Webcam
```

## Disclaimer

This model was trained on actually images scraped from google, which translates weirdly if you compare them to "IRL" images. Therefore, it was a bit cool to see it actually work even tho the testbed didn't quite meet the professional standards (in this case, through looking at my iPhone, lol).
